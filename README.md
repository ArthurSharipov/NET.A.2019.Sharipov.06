# Day-6
1. Develop an immutable Polynomial class (polynomial) to work
with degree polynomials in one variable of real type
(as an internal structure for storing coefficients
use sz array). For developed class
● override virtual methods of the Object class;
● overload operations allowed for working with polynomials (excluding
division of a polynomial into a polynomial), including “==” and “! =”.
Develop unit tests.
2. Implement the algorithm for “bubble” sorting non-rectangular (jagged array)
integer array (sorting methods of the System.Array class do not
use) so that it is possible to arrange the rows of the matrix:
● in order of increasing (decreasing) the sum of the elements of the rows of the matrix;
● in ascending (descending) order of the maximum elements of the matrix rows;
● in ascending (descending) order of the minimum elements of the rows of the matrix;
Develop unit tests.
